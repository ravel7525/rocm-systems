# Changelog for rocSHMEM
## Unreleased - rocSHMEM 3.8.0 for ROCm 10.x

### Added
* GDA device code refactor (#7217)
  * Core GDA device code is now header-only.
  * Removed indirection and branching when compiled for a single GDA provider.
  * Significantly reduced size of device code GDA Queue Pair management objects.
  * Reduced latency of `rocshmem_quiet` for AMD Pensando IONIC provider.
    This also reduces the latency of blocking communication calls.
  * Communications using the GDA backend can now selectively choose at compilation time
    to reduce the internal GDA Queue Pair object correctness and safety constraints,
    improving application performance when such relaxations are known to be safe by the caller.
    These relaxations can be applied independently at each call site.
    This is currently an internal mechanism and is not exposed by the public rocSHMEM APIs.
* Added standalone signal APIs:
    * `rocshmem_signal_add` and `rocshmem_ctx_signal_add`
    * `rocshmem_signal_set` and `rocshmem_ctx_signal_set`
    * `rocshmem_signal_wait_until`

### Deprecated
* Deprecated `rocshmem_signal_fetch_wg` and `rocshmem_signal_fetch_wave`.
  Use `rocshmem_signal_fetch` instead.

## rocSHMEM 3.7.0 for ROCm 10.1

### Added
* Added new APIs (#8350):
    * `rocshmem_tile_{min, max, sum}_reduce{_wave}{_wg}` variants for the IPC backend
    * `rocshmem_ctx_tile_{min, max, sum}_reduce{_wave}{_wg}` variants for the IPC backend
* Added tile RMA and collectives support for GDA backend (#10056)
* Added `--num_wf` argument to functional test harness for runtime wavefront size detection on architectures with wave size 32 (gfx1100, gfx1201, gfx1250) (#9312)
* Added LTO inline-remarks comparison toolset and interactive resource-usage dashboards under `scripts/analysis/` (#10872)
* Optimized device API wrappers to remove double-indirection in cross-TU calls, enabling more reliable LTO inlining (#9729)
* Reduced IPC RMA latency by caching symmetric heap base/size in device constant memory, removing hot-path heap metadata loads in `ipcPeerPtr()` (#9872)

### Changed
* **Breaking build-system change**: The five compile-time CMake options
  `USE_HEAP_DEVICE_FINEGRAIN`, `USE_HEAP_DEVICE_UNCACHED`,
  `USE_HEAP_DEVICE_COARSEGRAIN`, `USE_HEAP_DEVICE_VMM_POSIX`, and
  `USE_HEAP_DEVICE_VMM_FABRIC` have been removed. Heap allocator
  selection is now a runtime decision via the environment variable:
  ```
  ROCSHMEM_HEAP_ALLOCATOR_TYPE=<uncached|finegrained|coarsegrained|vmm_posix|vmm_fabric>
  ```
  The default is architecture-dependent: `finegrained` for gfx1100/gfx1201,
  `uncached` for all other targets. The VMM allocator sources are now compiled
  unconditionally (when ROCm ≥ 7.2 / AMD SMI fabric handle support is
  detected) rather than behind build flags. (#9432)

### Resolved Issues
* Fixed `reduce_wg` and `reduce_wave` operations producing incorrect results for some scenarios
* Fixed compilation of rocSHMEM when using clang++ instead of hipcc
* Fixed team-relative PE rank computation in GDA alltoallv
* Fixed `USE_SDMA=ON` builds failing for GDA+IPC with messages >128B
* Fixed libverbs/libmlx5 discovery using `.so.1` versioned symlinks in GDA backend
* Fixed Broadcom NIC (bnxt) dmabuf CQ/SQ creation (#9465)
* Fixed ASAN build: correct string size for socket, exclude libhsa (#10507)
